# Sample user-register for YP2's simple authentication.  Each
# non-blank line either begins with a hash (in which case it is a
# comment, and is ignored) or is a user-register entry.  Each entry
# consists of three colon-separated fields: a username, a
# corresponding password, and a comma-separated list of the databases
# that user is allowed to access.
