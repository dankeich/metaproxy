A Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the YP2 Classes
========================================

Introductory Notes
------------------

In general, classes seem to be named big-endianly, so that
"FactoryFilter" is not a filter for factories, but a factory that
produces filters, and "FactoryStatic" is a factory for the statically
registered filters (as opposed to those that are dynamically loaded).


Classes
=======

FactoryFilter
-------------

A factory class that exists primarily to provide the create() method,
which takes the name of a filter class as its argument and returns a
new filter of that type.  To enable this, the factory must first be
populated by calling add_creator() for static filters (this is done by
the FactoryStatic class, see below) and add_creator_dyn() for filters
loaded dynamically.

FactoryStatic
-------------

A subclass of FactoryFilter which is responsible for registering all
the statically defined filter types.  It does this by knowing about
all those filters' structures, which are listed in its constructor.
Merely instantiating this class registers all the static classes.  It
is for the benefit of this class that struct yp2_filter_struct exists,
and that all the filter classes provide a static object of that type.
