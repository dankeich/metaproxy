This directory contains documentation generated by human hands.  In
contrast, ../dox contains documentation automatically generated by
doxygen from the API declarations.

Eventually, everything in this directory will become an integrated YP2
manual written in DocBook, like the YAZ and Zebra manuals.  For now,
though, we have separate files:

README -- this file.
config -- describes the YP2 configuration file.
