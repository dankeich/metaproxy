This directory contains documentation generated by human hands.  In
contrast, ../dox contains documentation automatically generated by
doxygen from the API declarations.

Eventually, everything in this directory will become an integrated YP2
manual written in DocBook, like the YAZ and Zebra manuals.  For now,
though, we have separate files, which might perhaps best be read in
the specified order:

README -- this file.
filters -- lists and briefly describes the various filters.
config -- describes the YP2 configuration file.
multidb -- virtual databases and multi-db searching (complicated!)
classes -- describes some of the classes in the YP2 source code.
