  <refpurpose>Module for rewriting HTTP content and headers</refpurpose>
 </refnamediv>

 <refsect1><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>
   The primary purpose of this module is to rewrite links (URLs) for
   proxying. The configuration is divided in two sections:
   request and response for dealing with the HTTP request and response
   respectively.
  </para>
  <para>
   Each section consists of rule and content elements. Each rule must be
   given a name (attribute "name") and these are referred to from
   content elements. The content defines what rules are invoked.
  </para>
  <para>
   Each rule consists of one or more rewrite elements. The rewrite
   specifies a regular expression for matching content in the attribute
   "from" and the corresponding attribute "from" specifies the result.
   The "to" result may refer to named groups in any "from" pattern already
   executed. For example, in the response section a rule may refer to both
   groups in the response already executed and all rules exectuted in the
   request section.
  </para>
  <para>
   Each content section takes exactly one "type" attribute, which specifies
   what area is inspected for rewriting. Type may be one of
   "html" (for HTML content), "headers" for HTTP headers or
   "quoted-literal" for Java Script type of content.
   The content section takes one or more "within" elements. That specifies
   where inside the content, each rule is being exectuted. All within
   must have a "rule" attribtue that specifies the rule section to be
   invoked (rule@name as mentioned earlier).
  </para>
  <para>
   For "html" content, the within element takes also attributes "tag"
   and "attr",that specifies tag and attributes to be inspected.
   The attr attributes takes one or more attributes (comma separated).
   If no "tag" is given, the rule is performed on all attributes
   with the name given.
  </para>
  <para>
   For "headers" content the within element takes "header" or "reqline" +
   the "rule" attribute. For "header", the rule is performed on all
   HTTP headers with the name in header. For "reqline", the
   HTTP Request line is rewritten.
  </para>
  <para>
   For "quoted-literal" content, the within element takes only a
   "rule" attribute and the rule is performed on all content.
  </para>
