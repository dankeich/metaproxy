This is a very simplified example of a loadable metaproxy module

There is a simple makefile, that does not depend (very much) on the
main metaproxy stuff.

You can run the server with 

   make run

Then connect to it with a yaz-client localhost:9000. The module sees the 
init request, and rejects it with a system error.
