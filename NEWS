--- 1.3.20 2011/12/21

zoom: return diagnostic if CQL sortby conv fails.  Diagnostic Bib-1 214
"Illegal sort relation" is returned. Gets translated to SRU diagnostic
90: "Unsupported direction value".

zoom: honor database argument nocproxy. This disables creating a content
connector session (for non-CF targets, usually) and also relays nocproxy
as database argument to a CF target.

--- 1.3.19 2011/12/16

zoom: Multiple proxy hosts may be given for proxy rich database 
parameter. List is comma separated.

http_file: decodes URI paths properly. Does not return 404: not found
if no prefix are matches. Instead packages are passed on.

--- 1.3.18 2011/12/08

zoom: content-{user,password,proxy} are passed on to content proxy
system and takes precedence over user,password,proxy .

sru_z3950: SRU extra argument x-log-enable=1 enables a search response
with a log element including log material from children filters. At
this point, only the zoom filter uses this log facility. It will
eventually be used by other filters as well. In particular it might be
useful for this feature to track all filters in used during a search.

zoom: for x-log-enable=1, APDUs sent by ZOOM C, records as received
and queries as they are manipulated are logged.

zoom:  extend addinfo with native diagnostics. Diagnostics as received
by ZOOM C are put into addinfo - including ZOOM, HTTP, SRU and Bib-1
diagnostics. This indicates both a backend diagnostic and the original
form.

zoom: default urlRecipe value is ${md-electronic-url}

zoom: target profile setting sruVersion is recognized.

--- 1.3.17 2011/11/17

zoom: log target profile record fetched (AKA Torus).

--- 1.3.16 2011/11/17

Change target profile parameter CfSubDb to CfSubDB.

--- 1.3.15 2011/11/12

zoom: bug fix: realm was relayed to CF targets by mistake (realm only
makes sense to the zoom module itself).

--- 1.3.14 2011/11/11

zoom: realm may be given as part of database.

--- 1.3.13 2011/10/26

Fix Origin class assigment method; was removd by mistake in 1.3.12.

--- 1.3.12 2011/10/26

zoom: database args x-name=value are passed through to backend database.

SRU filter: user may specify session ID that is passed to log entries
that follows. It is specified by using x-session-id in the SRU arguments.

zoom: fix null pointer reference which would occur for bad url parameter
inside "torus" or if url was not given.

--- 1.3.11 2011/09/09
Fix bug in filter session_shared where sessions would not expire
properly (session ttl). This in turn could make the target close the
connection before expected and session_shared would return diagnostic
2: system temporarily available.

--- 1.3.10 2011/09/09

zoom: new target profile setting: sortmap_field. If sortmap_field is given
the field is mapped to the value for the sortmap. Values not matching
sortmap_field are passed verbatim.
  
zoom: new target profile setting: sortStrategy. One of: "z3950", "type7",
"cql", "sru11" or "embed". The "embed" chooses type-7 or CQL sortby
depending on whether RPN or CQL is actually sent to the target.

--- 1.3.9 2011/08/25

zoom: urlRecipe result is stored in <pz:metadata type="generated-url">.

zoom: For content proxy authentication is stored in param name
"auth", instead of "authentication".

--- 1.3.8 2011/08/22

zoom: relay schema in SRU mode. Previously recordSchema was not affected
by elementSet.

--- 1.3.6 2011/08/22

zoom: new target profile element literalTransform that holds XSLT
(encoded as string) for target. Only if present and non-zero length it is
considered present. This takes precedence over transform.

Don't rely on trang anymore for Git checkout builds. Configuration in etc
will only be properly validated if trang is available. From now on only
relax NC files are bundled with the source dist.

Updates to check for Boost unit test (autoconf stuff). On MacOSX this
component was not detected when it should be.

--- 1.3.5 2011/08/12

z3950_client: mark non-surrogate diagnostics from backend.

zoom: a proxy may be specified for HTTP fetch of target profiles.

--- 1.3.4 2011/08/01

Honor piggyback. Makes some SRU targets behave that insist on
maximumRecords > 0, but also increases performance.

--- 1.3.3 2011/08/01

Fix dlpath in installed metaproxy.xml for RPM/Deb package. The
file was not update for libdir/metaproxy4 in version 1.3.2.

--- 1.3.2 2011/08/01

Change location of Metaproxy modules from libdir/metaproxy to
libdir/metaproxy4. Directory libdir/metaproxy is also owned by 
libmetaproxy3 and, thus, should not be used by libmetaproxy4.

New facility to dump APDUs from zoom filter. Enabled by 
<log apdu="true"/> in the zoom filter configuation.

zoom filter bug fix: SRU diagnostics received from backend was
not properly converted to Bib-1 diagnostics.

Package metaproxy depends on libmetaproxy4, same version.

--- 1.3.1 2011/07/28

zoom: fix a bug WRT passing authentication parameters to backends.

--- 1.3.0 2011/07/27

Fixes for windows Makefile.

--- 1.2.10 2011/07/25 

Change major version of metaproxy library from 3 to 4. This in turn
makes new package names for Debian and RPM.

--- 1.2.9 2011/06/27

zoom: enable marc-8 encoding by default for usmarc and opac (in pz2
transforn mode).

zoom: configurable element sets for record transforms.
    
zoom: the target profile based transform is specified by element_transform
in element torus of of the ZOOM filter configuration ; default value
is "pz2". Target profile based retrieval is specified by element_raw
in configuration. It will perform same steps, but omit the XSL transform.
Default value is "raw".

zoom: element set is omitted if not set in profile. But only if pz2
transform is in effect. Previously the default element set was to "F".

zoom: For non-CF targets database arguments are parsed. User may supply
db,user=myuser&password=mypass for non-CF targets. These values override
what's given the authentication from the target profile.

session_shared: fix reference to freed memory. Would occur if a search
response had non-surrogate diagnostics.

--- 1.2.8 2011/06/22

Route may be given for each port in frontend_net.

--- 1.2.7 2011/06/22

Documentation for zoom filter. Local target profiles may be specified.

Fixes for zoom filter.

--- 1.2.6 2011/06/15

First version with zoom filter.

--- 1.2.5 2011/05/06

Filter z3950_client may be configured to always send a close APDU
to backend target when connection/session is closed. This will only
happen if close APDU is not already sent. Enabled by configuration
for z3950_client (force_close).

Filter virt_db and multi: relay close APDU.

Filter virt_db and multi: relay init size parameters 
preferredMessageSize and maximumRecordSize.

Filter sru_z3950: increase init sz parameters from 1MB to 10 MB.

--- 1.2.4 2011/01/27

RPM package for Metaproxy works for both SLES11 and Centos 5.5.

metaproxy-config: exec_prefix, libdir, includedir. Use these variables
as determined by configure.

RPM: Release includes 'indexdata' name. Use indexdata in release name so
this package can be distinguished from other vendors.

--- 1.2.3 2010/10/04

Fix filter multi: relay idAuthentication parameters.

--- 1.2.2 2010/09/15

Add metaproxy-config for returning compiler flags, libraries.

--- 1.2.1 2010/08/18

Fix --with-boost=PREFIX .

--- 1.2.0 2010/07/09

session_shared: fix use of maintenance thread.

Introduce 'start' method for filters and routers. It gets called after
configure and after fork, but before processing. This changes API -
from libmetaproxy2 to libmetaproxy3.

--- 1.1.7 2010/06/30

session_shared: ensure backend session is closed if init rejected
is received.

z3950_client: fix NULL ptr reference that could occur if two clients
connected concurrently and if max-sockets was in effect.

--- 1.1.6 2010/06/21

Fix bug 3497 - Metaproxy unstable while stopping.

Fix bug 3495 - SEGV in SRU filter.

--- 1.1.5 2010/06/15

Filter multi throws diagnostic 'Present Out of Range' when
appropriate - rather than returning 0 records.

Filter virt_db: fix bad result reuse. Could happen if a result
was overriden and a backend did not supported named result sets.

--- 1.1.4 2010/05/11

Filter log: category access logs diagnostics even if searchStatus
or presentStatus is 'success'.

--- 1.1.3 2010/04/21

The SRU to Z39.50 filter does repeated Z39.50 present requests
to fetch all records. Needed when a Z39.50 server returns partial
results (due to message size limits).

--- 1.1.2 2010/03/18

Metaproxy now kills all child processes that are spawned by
modules (in case of fork, exec).

--- 1.1.1 2010/01/28

Debian package now installs /etc/metaproxy/metaproxy.xml which
includes all XML files /etc/metaproxy/filters-enabled .
The include facility uses YAZ' yaz_xml_include_simple (YAZ 4.0.1).

--- 1.1.0 2010/01/20

Package based on YAZ version 4 and YAZ++ 1.2.0. It now includes a
development package to facilitate 3rd party Metaproxy modules.

--- 1.0.23 2010/01/04

Filter virt_db: Close backend filter session when Init rejected is received
from it (in which case it's not really closed yet). This will ensure we don't
run out of resources such as FDs in this case.

sru_z3950 filter: Accept any database (including those not listed).

--- 1.0.22 2009/12/03

Prepare for 64-bit YAZ. yazproxy will still work with YAZ++ 1.1.4 or
later which means YAZ 3.0.47 or later.

--- 1.0.20 2009/11/19

For filter virt_db, the database is a glob pattern and the virtual
database sections are consulted in the order given.

--- 1.0.19 2009/07/08

For filter multi, the target (for routing) may be given as a glob-pattern.

More documentation for filters virt_db and multi.

Update schema to allow for no database in sru_z3950 filter.

--- 1.0.18 2009/06/30

Added limit filter to put sleep (penalty) for heavy use.

Filter frontend_net may be configured to limit the number of new connections
from same IP to some value (connect-max).

Fixed the load_balance filter.

--- 1.0.17 2009/06/16

Fix path for metaproxy executable for Debian init.d script.

--- 1.0.16 2009/06/10

SRU to Z39.50 filter honors x-username and x-password. If only
x-username is given that translates to open authentication (Z39.50v2). If
both x-username and x-password is present that translates to idPass
authentication (Z39.50v3).

New facility to change current working directory (-w).

Update to upstream skeleton of init.d script. Should fix bug #2619.

Filter session_shared now caches records (used to only cache connections
and result sets).

Filter session_shared now invalidates a Z39.50 session if a server
returns -1 hits. This facility was also part of yazproxy and gets around
a bug in Voyager-based Z39.50 servers.

--- 1.0.15 2008/11/18

Fixed reference counting bug in Z39.50 client module (could cause SEGV).

--- 1.0.14 2008/06/09

Fixed the value of SRU record schema in searchRetrieve response. It was set
to a fixed value of "dc" before.

Serialize identical SRU requests. This is useful if HTTP client software
fires identical requests against metaproxy.

Allow Z39.50 target to be specified for SRU requests by using SRU extra
parameter x-target. Allows SRU to contact arbitrary Z39.50 targets and
avoid static configuration. This facility is handled by the sru_z3950 module
and the z3950_client module.

Allow maximum number of sockets to be used for a Z39.50 client by the
use of SRU extra parameter x-max-sockets. This facility is handled by the
sru_z3950 module and the z3950_client module.

--- 1.0.13.1 2008/02/29

Simplified check for Boost libraries.

--- 1.0.13 2008/02/29

First Debian package.

The sru_z9350 filter now recognizes SRU parameter z-target as being
a ZURL of the form host/database . 

Mergetype may be specified for filter 'multi'.

--- 1.0.12 2007/09/19

Fixed problem in Makefile WRT library specifictions. This could produce
linker errors (when they should not happen).

Fixed bug #1341: MetaProxy returning different results. Problem was that
fix-up of record database did not normalize the database name.

Documentation updates for Windows compilation.

--- 1.0.11 2007/06/14

Fixed problem with logfile being truncated.

--- 1.0.10 2007/05/23

Fixed bug #1136: Access rights not enforced.

New category 'user-access' added which is simlar to 'access' but adds
the Z39.50 user as for all entries in a session.

Switched to GPL v2.

Added support for configurable default/force target/vhost for module Z39.50
client module.

--- 1.0.8 2007/01/25

sessions and result sets.

New filter, record_transform, which converts MARC/XML records.

New filter, sru_z3950, which converts SRU to Z39.50 packages.

New filter, load_balance, in development.

New filter, zeerex_xplain.

XML framework for config files started.

Master RelaxNG Compact schema's are found in xml/schema/*.rnc,
RelaxNG XML schemas and XML Schema's are generated from RNC syntax.
XML config files are checked against RNG and XML Schema's.

XSLT transformation framework added in xml/xslt/*.xsl, consisting mainly of 
LOC Marc21 stylesheets found at http://www.loc.gov/marcxml/xslt.
Added stylesheet explain2cqlpqftxt.xsl which transforms a standard SRU ZeeReX 
explain record to YAZ CQL-to-PQF text config file. 

--- 1.0.7 2006/11/07

Added 'timeout' setting for filter frontend_net which specifies the number
of seconds a session is idle before it is closed. Default timeout is
300 (5 minutes).

--- 1.0.6 2006/07/07

Database name in records returned set for virt_db/multi filters.

Filter session_shared now functional.

Log filter can be configured to write to a given file using 'filename'
element. Also information category can be specified with 'category'. If
filename is omitted, the log filter writes to stdout. See etc/config5.xml
for example.
